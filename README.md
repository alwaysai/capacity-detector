# Capacity Detector
This application is meant to detect people from a live or recorded video stream and determine if they are entering or exiting a location. That info is then can be sent via a POST call to a URL endpoint for processing.


**ENTRY-EXIT ZONES**
The app uses configurable entry and exit zones to determine if someone is entering or exiting a location. Zones are made up of rectangular areas in the video frame. Multiple entry and exit zones may be added to fit complex environments.

*ENTER CRITERIA*: When a detected person crosses from an entry to an exit zone, then disappears from tracking.

*EXIT CRITERIA*: When a detected person crosses from exit to an entry zone, then disappears from tracking.

*IGNORE CRITERIA*: Any detected person who does not cross both an entry and exit zone before tracking of them ends.

**JSON PAYLOAD**
When either an entry or exit is detected, the app will send a call to the URL endpoints designated in the `config.json` file. The payload consists of the following:
```
{
    "device_id": "<id_of_app_instance>",
    "timestamp": <UTC seconds epoch>
}
```
